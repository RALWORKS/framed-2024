# I think I've been framed
Your boss framed you for the murder of JEFF MCKENZIE.

6 months ago, he promoted Jeff over you, although you had much more seniority.

Then Jeff found out the boss was involved in orgnized crime, and he ordered a hit.

You're so checked out of work and life that his name doesn't ring a bell when Marie
mentions it.

Yesterday, you were drugged & dropped off at McKenzzie's house at 2AM.

McKensie's homeless brother saw you dragged upstairs through a window, so he believed
you when you staggered back down those stairs an hour later, blood on your hands, to
tell the first person you saw that there was a dead man upstairs and it wasn't your
fault--though he struggled with communication enough that he can't tell you all this
upfront when you meet again.

Fleeing the scene, you stole an e-scooter from a teenager.

You later abandoned it and got on the first bus you saw, to ride it as far away as
it would take you.

By morning you were at Marbury Ave. and 3rd street, and, still recovering from being
drugged, not at all sure of how you came to be there.

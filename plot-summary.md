# I think I've been framed
Your boss framed you for the murder of JEFF MCKENZIE.

6 months ago, he promoted Jeff over you, although you had much more seniority.

Then Jeff found out the boss was involved in orgnized crime, and he ordered a hit.

You're so checked out of work and life that his name doesn't ring a bell when Marie
mentions it.

Yesterday, you were drugged & dropped off at McKenzzie's house at 2AM.

McKensie's homeless brother saw you dragged upstairs through a window, so he believed
you when you staggered back down those stairs an hour later, blood on your hands, to
tell the first person you saw that there was a dead man upstairs and it wasn't your
fault--though he struggled with communication enough that he can't tell you all this
upfront when you meet again.

Fleeing the scene, you stole an e-scooter from a teenager.

You later abandoned it and got on the first bus you saw, to ride it as far away as
it would take you.

By morning you were at Marbury Ave. and 3rd street, and, still recovering from being
drugged, not at all sure of how you came to be there.

## Chapters

### 1: Initial Alley
You're getting off a phone call with MARIE. She's told you the police think you've
killed someone.
You contemplate your situation.

You can realize one or neiher of the following 2 clues:
+ you seem to have taken the bus here (out of character: you're not a transit commuter)
+ [by calling Marie back] that dead man is called Jeff McKenzie--a name that means nothing to you

### 1.5 Police Chase #1
A man yells "freeze" in an aggressive voice. The police have found you. You run.

Convey this with graphics & narrative, or via a minigame, depending what the team has
bandwidth for.

### 2: The Angry Young Punk
You run head on into a teenager, who yells at you. You seem to have lost the cops. This
kid is really mad at you. Seems to think you stole his (her?) e-scooter last night.
Well that's interesting.

It's possible to get this teen to tell you where you supposedly met, which is right near
a BUS STOP. Apparently you stumbled off the bus and ripped the scooter out of his/her
hands.

### 3: Bus Stop
Only one bus comes here. If you cross to the *opposite* side of the street, it'll take
you back where you came from. But do you want that?

While you deliberate on what to do, you are accosted by a homeless man who seems very
happy to see you.

### 4: McKenzie the Younger
This man seems very relieved that you're OK. He tells you cops are coming and points you
back into the alley.

Apparently he *also* ran into you last night. He insists that it's OK, that Jeff was his
brother, and that he believes you.

This is the second opportunity to learn the name of Jeff McKenzie. If you haven't been
told yet, McKenzie the Younger will connect the dots.

### 4.5: Police Chase #2
Same as above

### 5: Dorian's Boss
You run head on into somebody for the second time in as many hours.

It's your boss. And he is *really* wigged out seeing you here. Actually, he looks like
he doesn't want to be *seen* with you. He's unravelling a bit--saying things like,

"How are you even awake? You were supposed to be at his house when the cops came. Shit.
Shit!

DORIAN: Calm down. I didn't kill the guy. I didn't even know him.
BOSS: Didn't *know* him? You worked with him for 6 years! I promoted him over you!

Well.

A man you *definitely* don't know pulls up in a black car. The boss jumps in and leaves.

### 6: McKenzie the Younger #2
The homeless man from earlier runs head on into you, pushing you back into the alley.
He says those are the guys that dragged you up the stairs when you were passed out.

You should run. The cops will be here soon.

### 6.5 Police Chase, intercut with flashbacks.
The flashbacks can be pure text over a black screen, or use very limited visuals.
They should be short & punchy.

It should be possible to lose the police chase and get a bad ending.

Otherwise, the game ends when the flashback is complete and you escape.

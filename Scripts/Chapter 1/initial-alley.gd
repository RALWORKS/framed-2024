# "initial-alley": Alley

DORIAN stands in an alley doorway, phone held up to his ear.

MARIE's voice yells from the phone speaker.

MARIE (telephone): Just come home! God, Dorian, whatever happened--whatever you did just tell me where you are! I'll come I'll help you! I'll--

Dorian hangs up.

DORIAN (to himself): Where I am--

He glances around for a street sign; catches sight of one.

DORIAN: Marbury and 3rd, seems like. Christ. I need to stop drinking.

DORIAN: What I did--

DIP TO BLACK

VO: I have no idea. But it sounds like I've been framed for murder.

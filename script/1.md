# I think I've been framed

DORIAN is a man in his 30s, unhappy in his life and work and drinking to cope.

MARIE is his sister--the last person in his life still trying to maintain a relationship
with him through his self-destruction and vitriol.

# SCENE ID "initial-alley": Alley
DORIAN stands in an alley doorway, phone held up to his ear.

MARIE's voice yells from the phone speaker.

MARIE (telephone): Just come home! God, Dorian, whatever happened--whatever you did just
tell me where you are! I'll come I'll help you! I'll--

Dorian hangs up.

DORIAN (to himself): Where I am--

He glances around for a street sign; catches sight of one.

DORIAN: Marbury and 3rd, seems like. Christ. I need to stop drinking.

DORIAN: What I did--


*DIP TO BLACK*

VO: I have no idea. But it sounds like I've been framed for murder.

DORIAN takes out his phone, dials, and holds it to his ear.

MARIE picks up after a single ring.

MARIE: What?

A homeless man in a doorway calls out to Dorian.

HOMELESS MAN: Hey! Hey buddy!

## OPTIONS
"Uh ... hey. Do you know me too?" --> "homeless-man-knows-you"
[Ignore him] --> "ignored-homeless-man"

# SCENE ID "homeless-man-knows-you"
HOMELESS MAN: 'Course. You were in pretty rough shape last night. Don't know what they
               gave you, but you were out of it.

## OPTIONS
"Who's they?" --> "who-drugged-me"
"What happened?" --> "what-happened"
"Uh huh. In that case, do you know why the police are chasing me?" --> "why-are-the-police-chasing-me"

# SCENE ID "who-drugged-me"
HOMELESS MAN: Well, the people who dragged you up the stairs to him I'd assume.
              Shiny black car. Jeff musta got himself into *some mess*, poor bastard.
              He just got promoted, you know? Three months ago. It shouldn't have
              ended like this.

*DIP TO BLACK FOR VO*

DORIAN (VO): 3 months, huh? Wasn't I up for a promotion 3 months back? Whatever happened
             to that?

DORIAN (VO): Hmm. This is the wrong time to get bitter about work.

# SCENE ID "what-happened"
HOMELESS MAN: You were in no state to do anything when they brought you there son. I
              saw. Even when you stumbled back out all covered in blood, it was
              obvious. They're tryna get you outta the picture too, Lord knows why.

DORIAN: Brought me where?

HOMELESS MAN: To my brother's house. I've been hanging close by. He hates it when I do
              that, but I've been worried about him. He found out something he shouldn't
              have. So I watch his home in the night.

*DIP TO BLACK FOR VO*

DORIAN (VO): Creepy. OK.

HOMELESS MAN: So they pull up with the car, right? I think 'this is it; he's gonna die.'
              So I start throwing rocks at the window, tryna wake him. And then I see
              they're dragging this limp body out of the car. I thought *he* was gonna
              be framed for *your* murder. But no, you're breathing still. A real
              puzzler.

HOMELESS MAN: Until you stumbled out an hour later, bloody, saying there's a dead man
              and you don't know what to do. I told you: 'clean your hands in that
              puddle there, son, and then run.

HOMELESS MAN: The police too? Then they must have found his body. My older brother's,
              that is. Jeff McKenzie. They're trying to pin his death on you.

DORIAN: Why? I've never even heard of Jeff McKenzie.

HOMELESS MAN: All I can tell you is they think you have a motive. These people aren't
              sloppy about things like that. You don't live around here?

DORIAN: No.

HOMELESS MAN: Where do you work?

DORIAN: Grunnings Insurance.

HOMELESS MAN: Bam. There's your connection. Him too. Surprised you haven't run into
              each other. The local branch isn't that big.

DORIAN: I'm pretty checked out at work. And anyway, being someone's coworker is hardly
        a motive for murder.

HOMELESS MAN: Don't ask me, son. Ask yourself.
